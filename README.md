# Song Popularity and Music Metrics

The Million Song Database includes data from Echo Nest on the most popular contemporary songs including technical data on musical measures and metrics of individual songs. The Spotify database includes data for over a hundred million songs on the platform including categorical data on the identifying information of songs and quantitative data on the popularity of music. These datasets are joined, creating a dataset that allows for greater insight on music patterns and popularity. The resulting dataframe is normalized and aggregated to reduce redundancy, group related columns and rollup data into a more usable format. This dataset is pushed to an AWS SQL database where it may be interacted with through a Streamlit dashboard.
